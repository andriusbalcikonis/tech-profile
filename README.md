Notation:

- `***` I know it well, no additional studying would be needed (studied in detail / used in real projects recently)
- `**` Some studying/refreshing may be needed (studied it / used in real projects a while ago)
- `*` Studying would be needed (I know _why_ and _when_ it should be used, but not much about the details of _how_)
- `PN` TODO to study more with prio N

Notation:

- `***` I have used it and would use in next projects
- `**` I have not used it, but willing to try in next projects
- `*` I have not used it and also have doubts if it is for every situation
- `?` Just an untested idea
