# Logging

- Log at least errors & edit actions
- For errors generate traceback IDs & show them to people
- Log all info, that help trace things (IP, request ID, session ID, username, input)
- Log reasoning, why edit action was made.
- Log reasoning, why 400 (bad input) or 401 (forbidden) was returned.
- For SPA applications, log frontend errors & actions, that led to them
- Strip personal info (like passwords)
