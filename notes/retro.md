# Retrospective

Simple way to do retrospective:

- Just have a round of discussion amongst the team about the process, what could be improved.
- Plan individual tasks for improvements

More advanced way would be:

- Keep track of things to improve in a table:
  - Problem / idea
  - Who raised
  - When
  - Actions taken
  - Status
  - Comments
- During sprint retro meetings, collect feedback and update the table
- Take steps for some of improvements during the sprint
- Overview the changes during each retro
