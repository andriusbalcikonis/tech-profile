# Reviews

## Peer-reviews

Useful because:

- One of primary tools of code quality
- Can fix quickly
- Does not cost much

Ways to do it:

- MR comments / other tools
- Live in discussion

## Group reviews

Useful because:

- Knowledge sharing
- Tech discussions
- Catching unintentional commits/merges
- Finding showstoppers & cancelling deliveries to alpha
- Identifying and registering secondary code review fixes / tech debt

Costly because:

- Harder to make changes than in peer-review
- Takes a bit of time for all team

Ways to do it:

- Keep separate branch and use merge requests
- Use GitLab envs and compare Git commits
- Idea: have little job in CI to generate review link
