| 1   | MapReduce         | Takes list of empty strings, returns count of them.                                                          |
| 2   | MapReduce         | Takes a word in text, returns key=number of letters, value - empty string.                                   |

| 5   | MapReduce         | After grouping by key, calculates some value from group values for each key                                  |
| 6   | MapReduce         | Groups by keys, which were extracted in map step                                                             |

| 10  | NoSQL             | Partition tolerance - the system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures |
| 11  | NoSQL             | Availability - a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it succeeded or failed       |
| 12  | NoSQL             | Consistency - every read will return newest written version of data                                          |
