| 1   | Network of storage computers                                                         |
| 2   | Specific OS and server for shared file storage                                       |
| 3   | backup                                                                               |
| 4   | Yes, but utilized amount of each drive will equal the size of smallest disk          |
| 5   | Software is cheaper, win server OS has it built in                                   |
| 6   | 1. Redundancy for OS itself. 2. May change HDDs without stopping computer. 3. Faster |
| 7   | Controller card or software                                                          |
| 8   | Two Raid5 mirrored                                                                   |
| 9   | 1                                                                                    |
| 10  | 3                                                                                    |
| 11  | Stripping with mirroring combined                                                    |
| 12  | No. If single hdd fails, all data is lost                                            |
| 13  | Writes and reads splitting all bits to all hdds.                                     |
| 14  | Larger HD (summed up disk space)                                                     |
| 15  | Server versions are more expensive, even though they have more or less same features |
| 16  | Type 1 - native - works on metal, Type 2 - works on top of OS                        |
| 17  | VM checkpoints - you can mark and revert to them                                     |
| 18  | Virtual network is required for virtual machines                                     |
| 19  | Windows Server 2012+ feature for virtual machines                                    |
| 20  | Disk mirroring                                                                       |
